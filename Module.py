# Modules help organize code by sections
# module is a file that contains some python code
# group highly related codes/objects in the same module
# can contain functions/classes/variables

# Compiled python files

# Module search path // sys.path

# Packages (sub directory) // creata a __init.py__ file in the
# folder and python will treat the file as a package

# Sub packages
# also need a __init__.py in the sub-folder and
# use dot to access as well


# Intra-package references
# importing from sibling package
# from .(current level) /..(one level up)
# Use normal import better

# dir() Function
# we can get the list of attributes
# and functions in a package using this func

# Executing Modules as scripts
# if __name_-  == "__main__":
#   your script here when you run this file as main
