    """
    Take the following IPv4 address: 128.32.10.1 This address has 4 octets
    where each octet is a single byte (or 8 bits).

    1st octet 128 has the binary representation: 10000000
    2nd octet 32 has the binary representation: 00100000
    3rd octet 10 has the binary representation: 00001010
    4th octet 1 has the binary representation: 00000001
    So 128.32.10.1 == 10000000.00100000.00001010.00000001

    Because the above IP address has 32 bits, we can represent it as
    the 32 bit number: 2149583361.

    Write a function ip_to_int32(ip) ( JS: ipToInt32(ip) ) that takes
    an IPv4 address and returns a 32 bit number.

    ip_to_int32("128.32.10.1") => 2149583361
